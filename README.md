# Express App Learning

This is a simple Express.js application designed for learning purposes. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The application includes API endpoints to manage "Post" resources, with features like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or a MongoDB Atlas URI)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/firadfd/express-app-learning.git
   cd express-app-learning
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string. Example:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/express-app-learning
   PORT=3000
   ```
   Replace `MONGODB_URI` with your MongoDB connection string (local or cloud-based, e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

4. **Ensure MongoDB is Running**:
   If using a local MongoDB instance, ensure the MongoDB server is running:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

## Running the Application
To start the application, run:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file). You should see a console message like:
```
Server is running on port 3000
Connected to MongoDB
```

## API Endpoints
The application provides a RESTful API for managing "Post" resources. Below are the available endpoints. You can test these using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [cURL](https://curl.se/).

### Notes on the README Creation
- **Assumptions**: The repository `firadfd/express-app-learning` is assumed to be a basic Express.js application with MongoDB integration, featuring CRUD operations for a "Post" model, based on common patterns in similar repositories (e.g., `planetoftheweb/expressjs`). If the actual repository has additional features (e.g., authentication, additional models), please clarify, and I can update the README.[](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/expressjs)
- **Endpoints**: The API endpoints are inferred from typical Express.js CRUD setups. They include standard RESTful routes (`GET /api/posts`, `GET /api/posts/:id`, `POST /api/posts`, `PUT /api/posts/:id`, `DELETE /api/posts/:id`). If the repository uses different routes or additional endpoints, let me know.
- **Setup Instructions**: The instructions assume the use of `nodemon` for development (common in Express.js projects) and a `.env` file for configuration, as is standard practice.
- **Project Structure**: The structure is based on a typical Express.js project layout with `models`, `routes`, and `index.js`. If the repository has a different structure, I can revise this section.
- **Dependencies**: Key dependencies are listed based on common Express.js setups. I referenced `express` from the official Express.js documentation but tailored the list to what’s likely in the repository.[](https://expressjs.com/)

If you want me to verify specific details (e.g., exact routes, additional features, or specific files in the repository) or make adjustments to the README (e.g., add specific examples, authentication details, or deployment instructions), please let me know! I can also generate a chart or diagram of the API endpoints or project structure if you’d like a visual representation—just confirm, and I’ll create one.
